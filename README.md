While I love the generator over at [Fillerama](http://fillerama.io/) (Futurama was one of the best!), I wanted to be able to upload my own text. Therefore, I built this Firefox Extension to let me. While there's demo material, there is also a place to upload your own content.

***Custom content will not be saved if you delete or reload the extension, so save your content separately. Since there is a way to upload text files, you'll be able to reload your content fairly easily.***
